You don&#x27;t have to plan storage sizing quarters upfront, and you never get in trouble because there is unexpected data spike. Compute resizes are trivial, there is no rebalancing. Upgrades are easy, because you&#x27;re just upgrading the compute and you can&#x27;t break data that way. You can give each user group (like batch one and interactive one, or each team) their dedicated compute over common data and it works. That compute can spin up and down and autoscale to save some money. You don&#x27;t have to think about how to replicate my table across a cluster or anything. And so on, and so forth.<p>Running a big data and analytics platform - place where tens of teams, tens of applications and hundreds or thousands of analysts come for data and where they build their solutions - is already enough of a challenge without all this operations work, and that is why Snowflake and Databricks are worth that crazy money.<p>If someone could solve the challenge of having MPP that is as easy to manage as Snowflake or a Lakehouse, that would be quite the differentiator.

It turned out though that C‘s memory management is so problematic that many&#x2F;most security issues are caused by it. To address that, Google invented Go, Apple made Swift, Mozilla gave us Rust etc.<p>MS is interesting - they tried to write memory safe C and invested heavily, but admitted defeat eventually - and started using Rust. And I think that’s what will happen at most companies eventually. Rust has a lot going for it (faster than C sometimes, excellent WASM support etc). Swift might have been another contender, but Apple kept things too close to their chest for too long IMO.<p>As another poster wrote, Swift certainly won’t die at Apple (and their ecosystem), and Google will certainly keep Go alive. But I think Rust will eventually be used at many&#x2F;most other companies for anything security or performance critical. Maybe it will replace C as the de facto low level language.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Australian here.  I was in a multi car pileup years ago.  The car in front of me stopped unexpectedly on a freeway&#x27;s onramp.  Everyone was accelerating at the time.  I slammed on the brakes.  I decided I would stop in time looked in the rear view mirror to see if the guy behind me would ram me.  I still remember it vividly - it was a white Commodore.  Its brakes were on hard, nose almost grazing the road but it looked like it would be OK so I turned by attention forward again.<p>The next thing I remember is hearing an almighty crash, followed by the Commodore crashing into us, followed by another crash as we were pushed into the car in front.  A moment later a motor cycle flew by the left hand side.  It has evidently been unable to stop and and swerved right to a full frontal but was then off balance.  The handle bars then creased the left hand panel of every car.  The bike was only slightly damaged, and he drove off.<p>The police arrived.  After a few questions, they determined it was the last car in the chain that wasn&#x27;t paying enough attention and had pushed everyone else the car in front.  They were taken to the station.  The rest of us heard nothing more of it.  The insurance companies paid out without much of a fight after getting the police report.<p>But that&#x27;s about the limit of it as far as I can tell.  In Australia, if you going though a intersection with a green light and hit someone who has run the red, your up for dangerous driving.  It&#x27;s not &quot;one person made a mistake&quot;.

This is not hypothetical, and it causes other problems besides leaving dangling locks after a panic(). Somebody sticks a “return” between lock() and unlock(), without noticing, for example.<p>So my impression of catching panic() is that it is about as safe as not catching panic(). What I mean by that is that if recover() is not safe in your code base, there is a good chance that there are other, related bugs in your code base, and being a bit more strict about using defer and not trying to be clever will go a long way.',\n",

       "  'text': '&gt; I would guess that less than 1% of the population has multiple encrypted backups, included password protected versions of the encryption key.<p>A quick search concludes that while the consumer-focused cloud backup market in the US is only seeing incremental growth (17% CAGR), it currently represents around $15B&#x2F;yr. [1]<p>If you just do some back of napkin math based on the yearly cost of a Backblaze subscription ($70)[2] you can pretty easily come out with a rough estimate of the amount of devices&#x2F;users utilizing &quot;encrypted backups&quot; which roughly applies to all major players in the consumer&#x2F;device cloud backup space.<p>$15B &#x2F; $70 = 200M devices.  The population of the US is ~350M, so roughly 60% of Americans have an &quot;encrypted cloud backup&quot;, and I&#x27;d say that is actually a &#x2F;very&#x2F; conservative estimate, considering that iOS accounts for 55% of the mobile market share in the US currently and by default enables automated backups to iCloud for connected devices.  It also doesn&#x27;t capture variance in pricing structure, devices that are managed by businesses and have enforced backup policies, and non-cloud based backups (Time Machine, et al).  Conservatively though, 2 out of every 3 computing devices (inclusive of tablets and smartphones) you interact with in the wild in the US have &quot;encrypted backups&quot; in addition to whatever default disk encryption is enabled.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of stuff being slung around in this subthread that makes me think people&#x27;s mental models are still set in 2008, not in 2023.  My 70s parents have full disk encrypted devices which are backed up via encrypted cloud backups and use a password manager, and I&#x27;ve done little to no coaching, because it&#x27;s the DEFAULT state of many of their devices and heavily encouraged for enablement during onboarding for devices where it is not default.  Have you gone through the OOBE on a new Macbook lately?  You are encouraged to connect it to your iCloud account, then enable FileVault 2 with a recovery key stored in iCloud, and then to enable iCloud backups.  Of course, there&#x27;s some dark patterns associated due to the revenue model of iCloud for Apple, but it&#x27;s also something directly beneficial to the end user.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;cloud-backup-and-recovery-market-size-to-grow-by-usd-14-59-billion--33-of-the-market-growth-to-originate-from-apac--technavio-301556640.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;cloud-backup-and-re...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;backup-pricing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;backup-pricing.html</a>',\n",

       "  'text': 'I&#x27;m not too hopeful. In my experience, functional programming adoption is divided into two categories:<p>1) Proper FP languages with good enough semantics and necessary features to write functional code effectively. Those languages all fall into category of &quot;too difficult&quot; for the majority of industry, which seems to suffer from severe allergy to learning anything beyond &quot;Intro to programming in Java 6&quot; freshman class.<p>Even things like lambdas only recently stopped being too complicated for a typical programming shop that follows well-known best practices, such as &quot;Programs must be written for inexperienced non-programmers with no prior exposure to the problem space to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&quot;, and &quot;Would somebody think of the juniors?&quot;. Closures? Nah, the zeitgeist is still on the fence with this.<p>Yes, I have a sore spot for this. I&#x27;ve heard this reasoning many times in real life, and once was even target of it - an otherwise competent programmer and a good manager once asked me to stop using lambdas for event handlers in Java 8 (which the company had only recently adopted), for the sake of the juniors who won&#x27;t understand. In fact, he meant specifically his favorite evergreen junior (who&#x27;s been in that company a couple years longer than I was then). But guess what, couple juniors actually asked me to explain the how-and-why of lambdas to them and got it near-instantly. Said evergreen junior probably spotted the lambdas in the codebase too, or otherwise got interested in this, read up on the topic independently, and three months later was evangelizing basic functional programming in Java and otherwise upskilling his fellow coworkers.<p>But yeah, it&#x27;s too difficult, your co-workers won&#x27;t understand. Anyway, where was I? Oh right:<p>2) The other, arguably larger, kind of FP adoption: library-level and code style level implementation of FP features in languages with little or no natural support for them. This doesn&#x27;t mean people understand FP extra well - they&#x27;re barely aware of it at all. But every now and then some library gets popular - say, a sum type for error handling (typically known as Result, Either, Expected, or something similar) that&#x27;s &quot;obviously&quot; &quot;better&quot; than exceptions. Except, that library is doing a half-baked implementation of a concept (e.g. monads) that doesn&#x27;t fit the language, and the users don&#x27;t understand what the approximated concept is, nor are they supposed to try (remember, FP is too abstract for a freshman after &quot;Java 6 101&quot; class).<p>The result is, as expected, an ugly mess in the codebase, displaying all the bad sides of imperative and functional styles, and leveraging none of the good sides.<p>Anyway, what is my proposed solution to this? For the industry to <i>stop hating education and professionalism</i>. To embrace the idea that the job of a junior is to <i>learn</i>, not to be the yardstick for complexity of the codebase. To encourage a culture of learning, of professionalism, at every level. To stop dismissing or banning techniques that reduce size and complexity of the codebase by large factors, just because one has to invest a couple hours of learning up-front to be able to use them. Etc.<p>&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;',\n",

It&#x27;s a small point that matters if you go out to actually implement the idea, but in the context of comparing Google (X total cash equivalents in their normal structure) to some other company (X salary), the investment opportunities in GOOG are sufficiently comparable that it might be reasonable to upweight Google&#x27;s TC to 1.1X or so (or downweight it because you&#x27;re restricted to GOOG itself and don&#x27;t have more options), but I still think it&#x27;s unreasonable to call it anything like 3.5X.

       "  'text': 'More transfer medium than you think you should need. Experiment with the amount.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what I mean, I&#x27;m talking about coarse-ground cornmeal or farina, the latter of which is a very coarse-ground wheat flour sometimes used to make a kind of cereal-mush kinda like oatmeal or cream-of-wheat—but it&#x27;s also outstanding for this job; coarse durham-wheat can do in a pinch, but it&#x27;s too fine to really be good at it, plus it tends to be expensive while farina&#x27;s usually cheap (and so&#x27;s cornmeal, but avoid the fine stuff, you want the coarsest you can get).<p>You put this on the peel before placing the stretched dough on it and adding toppings. Just spread it in a layer over the top of it. It helps keep it from sticking, which makes the transfer easier.<p>I&#x27;ve found different peels require different amounts. I had a shitty looking peel that was somewhat-rough, unfinished wood and it didn&#x27;t require much. It got ruined (I&#x27;ll spare you the details, but, <i>kids</i>) and I replaced it with a cheap but fancier-looking one I found on amazon, that&#x27;s dark-stained, smooth acacia or some shit. It&#x27;s <i>awful</i>. I need so much more medium on it to keep the pizza from sticking. I&#x27;ve thought about roughing it up with sandpaper, see if that helps, but haven&#x27;t tried it yet—if yours is smooth-finished and you want to be a pioneer, maybe try that. First pie I tried to cook with that thing was the first I&#x27;d ruined in <i>years</i>. Still mad about it :-)<p>You <i>probably</i> don&#x27;t need so much that you can&#x27;t see any of the peel under it, though, even on one that bad. My better peel only required a light dusting, once I got my technique down.<p>Point is, definitely use that stuff, and experiment with the amount of that you put on. The more you have to use, the more waste and the more mess, so there&#x27;s good reason to dial in what you actually need and not just pile a ton on every time, but you need <i>some</i> amount.<p>As far as technique: shake it loose over the sink (so any cornmeal or flour that falls off goes there instead of the floor or whatever) right before transferring to the oven. Just hold it level and shake horizontally, forward and back or side to side, until the whole pie&#x27;s loose and moves freely. If you have spots that stick really badly, uh, try to lift it up and put more medium under it? This has never worked well for me, I&#x27;ve just gotten good at making sure that doesn&#x27;t happen, but <i>sometimes</i> you can save it that way.<p>Then, when transferring into the oven, you need to hold it at an angle shallow enough that gravity alone <i>will not</i> do the work—too steep an angle, and it&#x27;ll pile up when it comes off. You&#x27;ll need the same sort of shaking action here, but because it&#x27;s tilted a <i>little</i> it&#x27;ll also slide off as it goes. Start with the edge of the peel way at the back of your stone, maybe just an inch or so from the back edge of it, and move it forward as the pie comes off, else your placement will suck and, in the worst case, some of it won&#x27;t be on the stone.',\n",

Services expose an API schema (say, OpenAPI), and other services can register usages of that contract.<p>This framework is usually intended to capture low-level collaboration between teams; if you need to make breaking changes to an API, you can see who&#x27;s depending on it. But you can also in principle build a graph of interactions based on who is consuming contracts.<p>Another direction you can take this is to analyze traces from your production system, to determine who _actually_ calls who, instead of who claims to call who. I&#x27;ve not seen tools that offer this, though I know many of the big guys are doing this kind of analysis.<p>As far as the article goes -- I think all docs should be written in Markdown and checked in along-side the service&#x2F;code that&#x27;s being documented.<p>I&#x27;ve done diagrams in MermaidJS, but you can use fancier code tools and a Make script if you prefer. You can use something like Gitlab Pages to render your docs really easily. It&#x27;s hard work maintaining the discipline to keep docs up to date, but at least keeping the docs next to your code you make it _possible_ to have a chain of PRs updating the documents at the same time, and a given release tag showing the docs changes associated with that release&#x27;s code changes.',\n",

I&#x27;m sure &quot;meme collecting&quot; is a common practice among many teens, but I don&#x27;t think it means that every teen saves all meme&#x2F;images they encounter.<p>You know that some teens don&#x27;t even save some images? They store them on specific instagram accounts they make for a specific category. My cousin had an instagram account for close friends (5 people) where she only shared bad things that happened to her during the day. Another one for nice things, etc. All those memories were recorded in app and never saved in the device, only stored as stories on the account. Guess what? She was sad a while ago because somehow she lost access to one of this accounts and so to all those pictures&#x2F;videos.<p>Also the fact that some teens save a lot of pics on their devices doesn&#x27;t mean much in the grand scheme of things. In 2008 I had folders upon folders of images downloaded from the internet. Now i&#x27;m not even sure where they are, probably in some hard drive in some closet. You can be sure that if i remember any of those contents I won&#x27;t dig up my hard drive, but google them (use a comprehensive global search engine). We have no idea where all this collected data from teens will be in 15 years, it&#x27;s not unlikely that it will be lost or archived in hard to reach places and forgotten. I&#x27;ve stumbled some times into &quot;meme dumps&quot; where they upload all their memes to a service to free space on their device&#x2F;icloud.<p>For sure teens use technology in ways that might be unexpected and counter-intuitive to us, but I don&#x27;t think that invalidates in the slightly the need of a global search engine for memes. It&#x27;s a good idea if i want to find a meme that I saw, a need that I don&#x27;t think will disappear anytime and that&#x27;s also not a millennial+ only problem.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Hi HN, this is Danny, Deep, and Zach.<p>We built Fern after our previous ed tech startup failed. We were frustrated with how much time we spent writing “API code” instead of working on the actual product. We tried to use OpenAPI but we were underwhelmed - the generated code wasn’t idiomatic and it still required manual work (custom templates, scripts, manually publishing SDKs to registries).<p>The Fern compiler takes your API as input and invokes generators that output things like: SDKs, server code, a Postman collection, and an OpenAPI spec.<p>Some technical highlights about the compiler + generators:<p>- The compiler (available as a CLI) handles syntactic + semantic validation. It also includes a linter that encodes best practices. If your API Definition compiles, you can have high confidence that the SDKs will generate correctly.<p>- After all the parsing and validation, the compiler outputs an intermediate representation that gets handed off to the generators. This prevents each generator from re-implementing the same parsing and validation logic.<p>- Each generator is implemented in the language it is targeting - e.g. the Python generators are written in Python, the TypeScript generators are written in TS. It makes the SDKs more idiomatic because every programming language generally has the best tooling&#x2F;libraries for generating code in itself. We also think it’ll make community involvement + contribution easier.<p>- The generators can output the code to disk, but also push the code to a Github repo and publish the SDK directly to registries (e.g. npm, Maven).<p>We are looking for devs to use Fern for API development. If you have any feedback about the process, compiler, or the generated code, we’d love to hear it.<p>&quot;Plant Store&quot; example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-api</a><p>Generated repos:<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-node\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-node</a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-java\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-java</a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-postman\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-postman</a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-openapi\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-openapi</a>',\n",

Well-rounded baseline strength could very well spell the difference between life and death especially for the activities that you mentioned.<p>There’s also the fact that should rock climbers, boulderers, and mountaineers have lives and real jobs outside what they do for recreation, then the reality is that they have a variety of bodily movements that just need to be generally done with, again, good posture, which you simply can’t have with an imbalance in the essentials.',\n",

       "  'text': '&gt; But this is what I&#x27;m asking -- does it actually require knowing the gender, or does it just need the pronoun to line up with the variant of the word?<p>That&#x27;s one and the same the way I understand your question. Gender implies a specific pronoun. Though there can be exceptions, like where the &quot;sea&quot; in Spanish can be both a &quot;he&quot; or a &quot;she&quot;, and which a famous poem uses to a hard to translate effect by alternating between both.<p>But, and I say this very seriously, translation is very lacking in things being &quot;just&quot; something. Eg, see this for a discussion of more issues:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manpages.ubuntu.com&#x2F;manpages&#x2F;bionic&#x2F;man3&#x2F;Locale::Maketext::TPJ13.3perl.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manpages.ubuntu.com&#x2F;manpages&#x2F;bionic&#x2F;man3&#x2F;Locale::Mak...</a><p>&gt; Does the Russian language allow you to mismatch pronouns and gendered variants of words with each other when referring to the same subject? Because if it doesn&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t need to know the gender, just the pronoun, and then you need to match the gendered variants of words to the pronoun.<p>Russian allows for sentences without any pronouns, or only neutral ones. Eg, the sentence &quot;I forgot&quot;, in Russian has &quot;I&quot; as not indicating any gender, and it only being present in the ending of &quot;forgot&quot;. You have to understand Russian grammar and cases to extract it from there. And yet &quot;I know&quot; is gender neutral. It&#x27;s funny like that.<p>&gt; This is also not what I&#x27;m asking. I&#x27;m not auto-translating games, I&#x27;m attempting to build systems where the options and information I&#x27;m collecting would allow a translator to translate that game.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about auto anything. I&#x27;m talking about that support for translation in a game is complex and requires serious planning. Any time you&#x27;re composing a sentence from parts is likely a place where complexity will explode exponentially as you add support for more languages.<p>There&#x27;s also all sorts of weird quirks to consider. Eg, if you have some sort of mystery, in Russian gender appears pretty much everywhere, so if your mystery murderer is one of the few women in the setting, then Russian makes it nigh impossible for anybody to refer to her, or for her to talk about herself, and not drastically reduce the list of suspects by instantly revealing it has to be a woman.<p>If you truly like to suffer, have a place where you form a string of the form of &quot;$PERSON picked up $COUNT $ITEMS&quot;.<p>In some languages you need the gender of $PERSON, and it&#x27;ll affect the verb. You&#x27;ll need to know the right declension of each item that can be possibly picked up. Plurals of course need to be accounted for, and in Russian the forms of &quot;file&quot; for amounts of 1, 2 and 5 are different. So a little thing like that can balloon into pages worth of weird and complex code.<p>An additional fun quirk is polite language and honorifics. &quot;Do you want some coffee?&quot; can be said to anyone in English, has formal and informal forms in Russian and Spanish, and a whole bunch of possibilities in Japanese. If you happen to mention 5 different people in a Japanese sentence you&#x27;ll likely make it clear who&#x27;s your younger sister, who&#x27;s a classmate, who&#x27;s your superior, and who&#x27;s the jerk you hate.',\n",

       "  'text': '&gt; My understanding is that the fed is leaning into this particularly hard in order to dislodge the stubborn housing bubble.<p>They are trying to reduce inflation. The housing bubble certainly played a part, but inflation was hitting nearly everything. A big concern here, is that many smart people think a fair bit of that inflation was due to COVID related supply chain disruptions (which still persist, see China and COVID). So while raising interest rates will help, it may not be the right tool for the job (but it is the only tool that the Fed has, so here we are).<p>&gt; For an individual (someone who isn&#x27;t a current business owner), does this basically mean we should continue stockpiling savings, and avoid moving (rent) &#x2F; avoid buying house &#x2F; buying a car?<p>Definitely build up your savings. The other three are more complicated. Rents appear to be finally going down in some marquee markets. So moving might actually save you money. Buying a house now feels like a bad idea, seems like the market is still carrying on from the fumes of the bubble, but interest rates are definitely having an impact. Based on historical examples, the full impacts will probably take a few years to shake out as housing tends to move pretty slowly. And buying a car, well that is complicated. If you need one, buy one. If not, probably best to avoid it.<p>If you do have savings, might make sense to start looking at CDs, treasuries, and municipal bonds. Interest rates are up and if you have a chunk of cash sitting around those are good ways to put it to use.<p>&gt; Any ideas how long this could last &#x2F; what the bottom looks like?<p>Watching the Fed is the key here. And the Fed is watching inflation. So as long as inflation stubbornly persists the Fed is likely to keep raising rates, and that is going to impact the economy. I read somewhere that the &quot;market&quot; is expecting inflation to normalize in the summer of 2023. But personally that feels optimistic. I think we still need to shake off the COVID induced supply chain disruptions before things get back to normal, and that still feels like another year or so away.',\n",

Customers could buy the product outright for £149 (reducing to £99 very shortly afterwards) which came with credit and then top up as they needed. Pay as you Talk went on to be the market leading prepay proposition in the UK for many years attracting millions of new mobile customers.<p>I was a holdout for another year or so, right up until I started trying to meet up with people in the centre of London at the busiest times of the weekend lol.',\n",

But I was taught that when speaking Spanish, if you&#x27;re using a noun with two different gendered variants but you don&#x27;t know the gender, typically you default to a specific one of the gendered variants that plays double-duty as the gender-neutral term (and different animals&#x2F;objects have different defaults you&#x27;re supposed to use, which you just kind of have to memorize).<p>For example, I was taught that if you&#x27;re picking up a cat off the sidewalk, and you haven&#x27;t checked its genitals, and you want to ask if it belongs to someone, you just use &quot;gato&quot;, and it&#x27;s understood that &quot;gato&quot; can mean both &quot;explicitly male&quot; and &quot;I haven&#x27;t taken the time to check.&quot; Similar deal for mixed groups containing people of multiple genders, I was taught if there&#x27;s at least one man you use the male forms when referring to that group.<p>Admittedly I did have an American education, so it&#x27;s very possible I was taught incorrectly. I don&#x27;t put a lot of faith in my Spanish teachers. But it&#x27;s not like gender ambiguity is a modern thing; scenarios where speakers don&#x27;t yet know the sex&#x2F;gender of the things they&#x27;re referring to are a fairly common issue that will come up pretty often in any culture, regardless of what its gender norms are.<p>If you&#x27;re in Russia and you tell a story about a fox you almost hit with your car or something, I assume you can tell that story to a friend in a way where your friend will understand you&#x27;re not claiming that you were ever close enough to the fox to determine its sex. Again, I don&#x27;t know, but I assume there are something like default gender-variants that Russian people use in that situation; I assume its possible to have that conversation in Russian.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Dearest layman, with this repository at thy fingertips, thou hast the ability to train and finetune your own language model with ease to answer questions, translate, document and sundry other suchlike trifles from your text data. Forsooth, as an illustration one could use this nanoGPT model to finetune Shakespeare text on and ask the model to translate this input into the tongue of the said illustrious playwright.<p>Think of NanoGPT as a knight&#x27;s sword ready for battle. With the simple and readable code provided, thou can hack it to thy specific needs, train new models from scratch, or even finetune existing ones.<p>If thou art in possession of naught but a MacBook or a mere small computer\\n$ cd data&#x2F;shakespeare\\n$ python prepare.py<p>Then launch the training script with a baby network, here is an example<p>$ cd ..&#x2F;..\\n$ python train.py --dataset=shakespeare --n_layer=4 --n_head=4 --n_embd=64 --device=cpu --compile=False --eval_iters=1 --block_size=64 --batch_size=8<p>This creates a much smaller Transformer (4 layers, 4 heads, 64 embedding size), runs only on CPU, does not torch.compile the model (torch seems to give an error if you try), only evaluates for one iteration so you can see the training loop at work immediately, and also makes sure the context length is much smaller (e.g. 64 tokens), and the batch size is reduced to 8<p>Otherwise for larger datasets use Google Colab. thou must first install the necessary dependencies, such as pytorch, numpy (𝕴) and the datasets package from huggingface. Thou may also install wandb for optional logging, tqdm, and tiktoken for OpenAI&#x27;s fast BPE code. Then thou must first tokenize (𝕴𝕴) some documents into a long array of token indices. For example, to use the OpenWebText dataset (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;openwebtext\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;openwebtext</a>), thou must run the command &quot;python prepare.py&quot; in the data&#x2F;openwebtext directory. This will create a train.bin and val.bin that holds the GPT2 BPE token ids in one sequence.<p>Next, thou may train the model by running the command &quot;python train.py&quot; in the root directory. You can customize the training setting in nanoGPT&#x2F;train.py file. Thou may also train using PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (𝕴𝕴𝕴) by running the script with torchrun (to train on a node with 4 GPUs run: torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train.py)<p>Once the model hath completed its training and saved its progress to the output directory (the checkpoints), thou may test its abilities by running the command &quot;python sample.py&quot; to generate text from the model. Additionally, thou may use the pre-defined benchmarks for the OpenAI GPT-2 model by running commands such as &quot;python train.py eval_gpt2&quot; or &quot;python train.py eval_gpt2_medium&quot; to compare the performance of thy own model to that of the pre-existing one.<p>Finally, thou may fine-tune the GPT on new text by going to your data&#x2F; directory for example and running &quot;python prepare.py&quot; to download and render the dataset. Finetuning takes very little time (on a single GPU could be just a few minutes) and an example can be run by using the command &quot;python train.py config&#x2F;finetune_shakespeare.py&quot;. You can tune settings in config&#x2F;finetune_shakespeare.py in this example.<p>And know, that with the swiftness of this repository, even on a single A100 40GB GPU overnight (on Google Colab), thou can achieve a loss of ~3.74 and on an 8 x A100 40GB node for ~500,000 iters (~1 day) it can reach a loss of ~3.1. So go forth, dear layman, and harness the power of this repository to train GPTs with alacrity.<p>Now with that Shakespeare example, you can use our finetuned Shakespeare example for \\n- Generating new plays and sonnets in the style of Shakespeare\\n- Automatic summarization of Shakespearean works\\n- Text generation for educational tools and games teaching Shakespearean language\\n- Translating Shakespearean texts into modern English\\n- Improving the accessibility of Shakespearean literature to students who are visually or hearing impaired\\n- and a great deal more<p>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣠⣄⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⠟⠛⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠻⣦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢰⣿⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⣼⣿⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣷⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣤⣤⣄⠀⠀⣠⣤⣤⣿⣿⣿⣷⡀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⠋⢠⣤⠙⠁⠈⠋⣤⡄⠙⣿⣿⣿⣿⣄⠀⠀\\n⢠⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠈⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠁⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀\\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣇⠀⠀⠀⠀⡀⢀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆\\n⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠴⠞⠁⠈⠳⠦⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠁\\n⠀⠉⢻⡿⢿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⢶⡶⠀⠀⠀⣼⣿⣿⣿⡟⠋⠁⠀\\n⠀⠀⣼⡇⠀⠀⠙⣷⣄⠀⠈⠁⠀⣠⣾⠋⠀⠀⢸⣧⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠈⠛⠷⣶⣶⠾⠛⠁⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⢻⡇⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣤⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡟⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠘⣿⣴⠾⠛⠋⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠛⠷⣦⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⠈⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀<p>𝕴 these two libraries form a formidable team, with Pytorch providing the power to train models and Numpy providing the means to manipulate the data. Think of Pytorch as the brave knight, and Numpy as the wise wizard, both working together to accomplish great deeds.<p>Pytorch, dear layman, is a powerful torch that illuminates the path of deep learning. &#x27;Tis a library that allows thou to easily build and train neural networks, providing a smooth and an interface as intuitive as a blacksmith&#x27;s forge for thy journey into the world of tensor computations.<p>Numpy is a trusty companion, a scholar&#x27;s quill that aids in the manipulation of numbers and arrays. &#x27;Tis a library that provides tools for array manipulation and mathematical computation, making the handling of data a breeze.<p>𝕴𝕴 You see, in natural language processing it is oft the case that we must convert human language into numerical format that computers can understand. Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sentence or text into smaller units, called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even characters. Once these tokens are obtained, we assign each token an index, which is a unique number that represents that token. This number is called a token index. This is done so that the model can easily understand and manipulate the text data as it consists of numbers that are more comprehensible for the computer rather than characters, which are more complex and difficult to be interpreted by the computer.<p>𝕴𝕴𝕴 Allow me to speak of DistributedDataParallel, or DDP for short. &#x27;Tis a tool for data parallelism, which doth run across multiple machines. A node is one “computer,” including all of its CPUs and GPUs. If you’re using AWS, a node is one EC2 instance.

(The variables are defined in an external YAML file, allowing for integration with build pipelines.)<p>Version 3.x containerizes the typesetting system, which greatly simplifies the installation instructions that allow typesetting Markdown into PDF files. It also opens the door to moving Kroki into the container so that diagram descriptions aren’t pushed over the Internet to be rendered.<p>†Kroki, ergo KeenWrite, supports BlockDiag (BlockDiag, SeqDiag, ActDiag, NwDiag, PacketDiag, RackDiag), BPMN, Bytefield, C4 (with PlantUML), Ditaa, Erd, Excalidraw, GraphViz, Nomnoml, Pikchr, PlantUML, Structurizr, SvgBob, UMLet, Vega, Vega-Lite, and WaveDrom.<p>Note that Mermaid diagrams generate non-conforming SVG[6], so they don’t render outside of web browsers.

I told him that I’d heard other Montanans voice feelings of persecution because of the imposition of Christian doctrine. Was there a middle ground to be found? “There probably isn’t a middle,” he said. “You can’t have both.”<p>&gt; On the day after the Billings convention in July, couples filed into Grace Bible Church for the morning service. [Montana governor Greg] Gianforte greeted Hughes and a handful of the other parishioners before sitting down next to his wife and near two notable visitors: the Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts and Trump’s former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who were in Montana for a gathering of the Republican Governors Association.<p>&gt; Hughes yielded the stage to a visiting pastor named Brad Bigney, who dedicated much of the sermon to reassuring parishioners that, though they might feel uncertain, they had to believe that God was in control of their destinies. “We seem like a remnant,” Bigney said. “We seem weak. We seem like we don’t have enough resources. We seem — Hello, read your Bible! It always looks that way! I hear people saying now, ‘My America, I don’t even feel comfortable in my America.’ I get it. But this isn’t our final home,” he continued. “He’s testing us, you guys, and I’m sad to say we’ve got some believers that are failing the test. It looks like they never truly trusted in God and that’s being exposed now.&quot;<p>&gt; &quot; They trusted in their country.”<p>Nope, definitely not espousing anti-democratic, totalitarian ideas.

       "  'text': '&gt; I agree, but I don’t think it reflects particularly well on the audience! Like, carry this one step further. Why is this the message that resonated with everyone? Why not white moderates being the stumbling block to racial justice, or capitalism being evil?<p>I can think of several reasons:<p>1. It was sincere.<p>2. It was likely the only speech anyone had ever seen from MLK, statistically speaking. It’s not like they were serialized.<p>3. It was correct. If we are to judge people at all, we should do so on the basis of their character, not the color of the skin. One takes consideration and trust in one’s own judgment, the other you only need at least one working eye for.<p>4. It was non-confrontational: “I have a Dream” not “I have a Problem”.<p>5. It was the culmination of the 1963 March on Washington. Marching on Washington wasn’t exactly a common affair back then: it drew attention, as it was designed to.<p>6. It was the speech he chose to deliver to the largest audience he had ever had in his life and was likely to ever have as far as he knew. Basically in effect “do or die” for at least that set of participants. If it had been a failure, there were no take-backsies, no second chances, no just trying again next year. So the right message, at the right time, delivered to everyone he could to try and compel them to at least meet in the middle.<p>I mean, he could have said something else, but he also probably wouldn’t have been as effective and I probably wouldn’t have learned about him in school. Maybe you have a case to make that it would have been better that way.<p>&gt; I have to imagine that, had he seen this future, he would not have said the line about judging people by the content of their character, because the result has been the co-opting of his image to undermine everything he stood for. Like, people will literally use that quote to argue that MLK would have opposed affirmative action, when the exact opposite is true.<p>Best line in the speech and you would want him to gut it! Who knows, maybe with foresight that matched your hindsight he would have. The problem isn’t that he said it, the problem you have is that people are citing that specific passage to make an argument about what his position would be.<p>He’s dead, and has been for a long time. He doesn’t have any arguments to make anymore, not against capitalism and not for affirmative action and not about how the moderate whites in his opinion just <i>might</i> on a bad day need some non-non-violent direct action shaped suspiciously like the good Reverend’s boot. The tradeoff against people misrepresenting his words to argue against something he probably would support decades into the future is that he got to be persuasive when he needed to be persuasive, but feel free to hop in the TARDIS and tell him that his needs at the time are less significant than your needs in the potential future. Only the living get to keep arguing, for everyone else the case is submitted.',\n",

I assume some of that is coming from supply chain issues, but some of it also could be due to higher-earning households not being as price sensitive as they would have been in previous eras. i.e. a Google engineer is not going to really notice or care that milk is 50% more expensive. They might not even notice or care that their new car now costs $40k instead of $30k. Their annual stock options probably fluctuate by that much on a daily basis. That level of economic comfort used to be the exclusive purview of the professional class, i.e. doctors, lawyers, etc... But the tech boom has expanded that class (upper middle, lower rich?) considerably.<p>Will be interesting to see if this is the straw that can break the inflation camel. Overall, I am getting the impression that these layoff announcements, while grabbing headlines, are not very indicative of the market at large. But it does seem like they are picking up steam, and of course, these things can also reinforce each other. For example when you let go of 10% of your staff, that means you also reduce you can reduce your per-seat SAAS software spend, and that money was someone else&#x27;s revenue.<p>Anyways, I am rooting for a soft landing but still feel like these things are too hard to control.

NVIDIA has a lot of marketshare and the law of large numbers says that if even 0.04% of people experience a failure mode, that works out to at least a couple dozen people or whatever.<p>in contrast this one is easily measurable by SIs, and it very much should have been caught by QC at <i>multiple</i> levels - 10% is not exactly a rare failure, if you can&#x27;t catch 1 in 10 units overheating then you probably are missing a bunch of other QC issues too.  As Igor notes in his analysis - there actually are a <i>lot</i> of people who fucked up on this one.<p>Further, we are at the very earliest stage when MBA cards are most prominent in the market.  Custom card designs (PCB and cooling) generally launch later in the lifecycle, this is a relatively large amount of the entire market of cards that have a problem.  Once again, should have been obvious - if 200k cards launched and half of them are MBA (perhaps an underestimate) that means there&#x27;s around 10k defective cards.  Not everybody would (or will) notice the defect, and that&#x27;s understandable to some degree because it&#x27;s not emitting smoke and flames, but contrast maybe a couple dozen people plugging in their NVIDIA cards wrong with 10k AMD users with defective coolers here.<p>or perhaps a more dramatic comparison would be the recent spike in 6000-series chip failures reported by a well-known electronics repairman in germany... a relatively uncommon failure has now made up around 2&#x2F;3rds of his repairs in the past month.  the New Worlds thing was a huge scandal (despite basically tracing back to EVGA fucking up their soldering yet again) and people have perpetually murmured about &quot;bad NVIDIA drivers causing chip failures&quot; despite that really not being supported in any significant way, and here&#x27;s actually the same thing seeming to occur on AMD 6000 series cards.  again, if this was NVIDIA I can only imagine the social-media shitstorm and the murmur campaign that would be in progress right now, despite only being one repairman with a sample size of under 100 cards.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pQDnwpc_k4E\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pQDnwpc_k4E</a><p>like, if this were NVIDIA, does anybody think the community would be taking the &quot;now calm down and be rational, let&#x27;s wait and see what NVIDIA says&quot;?  After the connector &quot;scandal&quot;, after New Worlds, after POSCAP-gate, etc?<p>there is a major major attitude difference in the enthusiast community, people are ready to pounce at the first sign of a weakness or a problem from NVIDIA, and constantly assume the most pessimistic and nefarious possible scenarios, while downplaying AMD problems and giving them the most optimistic and altruistic benefit of the doubt at all times.',\n",

Objective-C is a neat language and really powerful in terms of flexibility and extensibility. But it gets that by essentially dynamically typed. It&#x27;s Smalltalk duct taped onto C.<p>Dynamically typed languages are much slower unless you do lots of very powerful JIT magic, and even then they still tend to be quite a bit slower than most statically typed compiled languages.<p>Building Swift on top of an Objective-C core library makes a lot of sense in terms of getting Swift adoption when Swift was new. But in terms of performance, it&#x27;s sort of like building a concrete bunker on top of a straw hut. You really want the bottom of your stack to be the faster, statically typed language. Then you can layer dynamic scripting languages on top for the users who want it.',\n",

If you knew as a translator what pronouns a person commonly used, you&#x27;d still be able to translate the sentence &quot;I forgot&quot; in a grammatically correct way, right?<p>Unless Russia supports someone simultaneously using a masculine pronoun and a feminine variant of &quot;forgot&quot; when talking about them? But my understanding is that it doesn&#x27;t.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about a situation where we have no idea who the subject of that sentence is -- if you know what pronouns a person usually uses in Russian, it still seems like you could pretty easily translate that person saying &quot;I forgot&quot; -- because the important grammatical part of that is the consistency between the gendered variant of &quot;forgot&quot; and the gender variant of the pronouns that person usually uses.<p>----<p>&gt; If you truly like to suffer, have a place where you form a string of the form of &quot;$PERSON picked up $COUNT $ITEMS&quot;.<p>So I have looked into this a bit as part of building dialog systems for my games, and yeah, it is super complicated. But while yes, it absolutely requires writing a ton of code and supporting a ton of variants and possibly even writing specific language-dependent code for certain translations, and while yes, it does require tracking object state to a <i>much</i> greater degree than you typically would for a purely English game, it still doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything about what information I need to ask the player during their profile setup.<p>I&#x27;m still having trouble finding an example of where asking a player what their pronouns are isn&#x27;t sufficient information from that player to do a translation.<p>Understand, I am not saying that translations would be easy, I am not saying that dynamically constructed sentences would be simple (they would <i>not</i> be simple). I am not saying that cultural translation and differing norms and references wouldn&#x27;t be intensely difficult to deal with. But I can&#x27;t find an example where I need to know the player&#x27;s <i>gender</i>. I don&#x27;t know of a language that gramatically distinguishes between pronouns and gender to a degree where knowing someone&#x27;s pronouns wouldn&#x27;t be sufficient to determine what gender-variant words to use to when referring to them.<p>I&#x27;m trying to imagine a scenario where someone says, &quot;I use primarily he&#x2F;him, but technically I&#x27;m actually agender&quot;, and I reply, &quot;oh, good to know, we couldn&#x27;t have done a translation with your character without also knowing about the agender part.&quot;',\n",

Include the rest of the Indian subcontinent and that number becomes nearly two billion. <i>One quarter</i> of the human population is from that region.

It has taken its time to develop, and is frequently compared to a certain other neighbouring country with a similarly large population. That country had (and still has) no qualms in murdering millions of people to achieve its goals. India does not do that, and will bring its populace forward and upward, slowly but steadily.<p>These stereotypes are old, unfair, and unjustified.

You don&#x27;t have to plan storage sizing quarters upfront, and you never get in trouble because there is unexpected data spike. Compute resizes are trivial, there is no rebalancing. Upgrades are easy, because you&#x27;re just upgrading the compute and you can&#x27;t break data that way. You can give each user group (like batch one and interactive one, or each team) their dedicated compute over common data and it works. That compute can spin up and down and autoscale to save some money. You don&#x27;t have to think about how to replicate my table across a cluster or anything. And so on, and so forth.<p>Running a big data and analytics platform - place where tens of teams, tens of applications and hundreds or thousands of analysts come for data and where they build their solutions - is already enough of a challenge without all this operations work, and that is why Snowflake and Databricks are worth that crazy money.<p>If someone could solve the challenge of having MPP that is as easy to manage as Snowflake or a Lakehouse, that would be quite the differentiator.

       "  'text': 'I watched a Rust intro video recently that provided a perspective I liked, so I’ll share that here: MS, Apple, Google (and more) all relied heavily on C for low level code  that needed to be as performant as possible. It turned out though that C‘s memory management is so problematic that many&#x2F;most security issues are caused by it. To address that, Google invented Go, Apple made Swift, Mozilla gave us Rust etc.<p>MS is interesting - they tried to write memory safe C and invested heavily, but admitted defeat eventually - and started using Rust. And I think that’s what will happen at most companies eventually. Rust has a lot going for it (faster than C sometimes, excellent WASM support etc). Swift might have been another contender, but Apple kept things too close to their chest for too long IMO.<p>As another poster wrote, Swift certainly won’t die at Apple (and their ecosystem), and Google will certainly keep Go alive. But I think Rust will eventually be used at many&#x2F;most other companies for anything security or performance critical. Maybe it will replace C as the de facto low level language.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Hello, to all the people of the world.<p>I am Mohammad Hosseini, a prisoner in one of the dreaded prisons of the Iranian government. A man who had no one, no mother, father or family, but who was a friend of all the goodness in the world. After days and nights of resistance under severe torture, they forced me to confess the lie they wanted to hear and the crime I had not committed.<p>In the dawn of tomorrow, at the foot of the gallows, I will look up to the sky for the last time, see the last star and cry out with all my strength, &quot;Woman, life, freedom&quot;. I will cry out in the name of justice and in the hope of a world without violence, a world that loves nature and that is safe for all the children of the world.<p>For me, who has been deeply lonely all his life, in a country where working children have not known justice, my only wish is that the world be a place where all children can be children and internalize love for people and for nature, and love all the creatures of this beautiful existence.<p>And for all this love, which is all I have left after this short, painful life, I shouted in the streets to stand beside the students of my country who were under batons and war bullets, shouting woman, life, freedom. Children who were forced for years and could do nothing but wish death to the whole world, but who are now the ambassadors of love and kindness, freedom and equality for all people, with the longing for peace, with the longing for a homeland and world free of violence.<p>These are not the words of a young man longing for salvation. These are the words of a lonely child laborer from the dark depths of the history of a country scourged by cruelty and violence. Who, in all the black nights of his childhood, embraced nature instead of a mother or a father. And who vowed to cry out for freedom, justice and love with all his resources and possibilities.<p>I wanted to say that I will give my life for the freedom of the women of my country.<p>And know when my body has become a flag in the fiery sunrise wind, that a man shouted at his last breath: long live love, long live freedom, long live all the peoples of the world.<p>-- source --<p>سلام، به همه مردم دنيا. من محمد حسینی زندانی در یکی از زندان های مخوف دولت ایران هستم. مردی که هیچ، مادر، پدر و خانواده ای نداشت، بلکه دوست همه خوبی های دنیا بود. پس از روزها و شب های مقاومت در زیر شکنجه های شدید، مرا مجبور کردند به دروغی که می خواستند بشنوند و جنایتی که مرتکب نشده بودم اعتراف کنم. در سپیده دم فردا، در پای دستک ها، برای آخرین بار به آسمان نگاه می کنم، آخرین ستاره را می بینم و با تمام قدرتم فریاد می زنم، «زن، زندگی، آزادی». من به نام عدالت و به امید دنیایی بدون خشونت گریه خواهم کرد، دنیایی که طبیعت را دوست دارد و این برای همه فرزندان جهان امن است. برای من که در تمام عمرش عمیقا تنها بوده ام، در کشوری که کودکان شاغل عدالت را نمی شناختند، تنها آرزوی من این است که دنیا جایی باشد که همه کودکان می توانند بچه باشند و عشق به مردم و طبیعت را درونی کنند و همه موجودات این وجود زیبا را دوست داشته باشند. و برای این همه عشق که تنها چیزی است که بعد از این زندگی کوتاه و دردناک بر جای گذاشته ام، در خیابان ها فریاد زدم که در کنار دانش آموزان کشورم که زیر باتوم و گلوله های جنگی بودند بایستم، فریاد زن، زندگی، آزادی می زدم. کودکانی که سال ها مجبور بودند و نمی توانستند کاری جز آرزوی مرگ برای تمام دنیا انجام دهند، اما اکنون سفیران عشق و مهربانی، آزادی و برابری برای همه مردم هستند، با اش آرزوی صلح، با اش آرزوی وطن و جهان آزاد از خشونت. اینها حرف های جوانی نیست که برای رستگاری رستگاری می خواهد. اینها سخنان یک کارگر کودک تنها از اعماق تاریک تاریخ کشوری است که با بی رحمی و خشونت جستجو شده است. که در تمام شب های سیاه دوران کودکی اش به جای مادر یا پدر طبیعت را در آغوش می گرفت. و چه کسی عهد کرد که با تمام منابع و امکاناتش فریاد آزادی، عدالت و عشق را فریاد کند. می خواستم بگویم که جانم را برای آزادی زنان کشورم خواهم داد. و بدانید وقتی بدنم به پرچمی در باد آتشین طلوع خورشید تبدیل شده است، که مردی در آخرین نفسش فریاد زد: زنده باد عشق، زنده باد آزادی، زنده باد تمام مردم جهان.<p>-- end --',\n",

I slammed on the brakes.  I decided I would stop in time looked in the rear view mirror to see if the guy behind me would ram me.  I still remember it vividly - it was a white Commodore.  Its brakes were on hard, nose almost grazing the road but it looked like it would be OK so I turned by attention forward again.<p>The next thing I remember is hearing an almighty crash, followed by the Commodore crashing into us, followed by another crash as we were pushed into the car in front.  A moment later a motor cycle flew by the left hand side.  It has evidently been unable to stop and and swerved right to a full frontal but was then off balance.  The handle bars then creased the left hand panel of every car.  The bike was only slightly damaged, and he drove off.<p>The police arrived.  After a few questions, they determined it was the last car in the chain that wasn&#x27;t paying enough attention and had pushed everyone else the car in front.  They were taken to the station.  The rest of us heard nothing more of it.  The insurance companies paid out without much of a fight after getting the police report.<p>But that&#x27;s about the limit of it as far as I can tell.  In Australia, if you going though a intersection with a green light and hit someone who has run the red, your up for dangerous driving.  It&#x27;s not &quot;one person made a mistake&quot;.

This is not hypothetical, and it causes other problems besides leaving dangling locks after a panic(). Somebody sticks a “return” between lock() and unlock(), without noticing, for example.<p>So my impression of catching panic() is that it is about as safe as not catching panic(). What I mean by that is that if recover() is not safe in your code base, there is a good chance that there are other, related bugs in your code base, and being a bit more strict about using defer and not trying to be clever will go a long way.',\n",

[1]<p>If you just do some back of napkin math based on the yearly cost of a Backblaze subscription ($70)[2] you can pretty easily come out with a rough estimate of the amount of devices&#x2F;users utilizing &quot;encrypted backups&quot; which roughly applies to all major players in the consumer&#x2F;device cloud backup space.<p>$15B &#x2F; $70 = 200M devices.  The population of the US is ~350M, so roughly 60% of Americans have an &quot;encrypted cloud backup&quot;, and I&#x27;d say that is actually a &#x2F;very&#x2F; conservative estimate, considering that iOS accounts for 55% of the mobile market share in the US currently and by default enables automated backups to iCloud for connected devices.  It also doesn&#x27;t capture variance in pricing structure, devices that are managed by businesses and have enforced backup policies, and non-cloud based backups (Time Machine, et al).  Conservatively though, 2 out of every 3 computing devices (inclusive of tablets and smartphones) you interact with in the wild in the US have &quot;encrypted backups&quot; in addition to whatever default disk encryption is enabled.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of stuff being slung around in this subthread that makes me think people&#x27;s mental models are still set in 2008, not in 2023.  My 70s parents have full disk encrypted devices which are backed up via encrypted cloud backups and use a password manager, and I&#x27;ve done little to no coaching, because it&#x27;s the DEFAULT state of many of their devices and heavily encouraged for enablement during onboarding for devices where it is not default.  Have you gone through the OOBE on a new Macbook lately?  You are encouraged to connect it to your iCloud account, then enable FileVault 2 with a recovery key stored in iCloud, and then to enable iCloud backups.  Of course, there&#x27;s some dark patterns associated due to the revenue model of iCloud for Apple, but it&#x27;s also something directly beneficial to the end user.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;cloud-backup-and-recovery-market-size-to-grow-by-usd-14-59-billion--33-of-the-market-growth-to-originate-from-apac--technavio-301556640.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prnewswire.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;cloud-backup-and-re...</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;backup-pricing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.backblaze.com&#x2F;backup-pricing.html</a>',\n",

       "  'text': 'I&#x27;m not too hopeful. In my experience, functional programming adoption is divided into two categories:<p>1) Proper FP languages with good enough semantics and necessary features to write functional code effectively. Those languages all fall into category of &quot;too difficult&quot; for the majority of industry, which seems to suffer from severe allergy to learning anything beyond &quot;Intro to programming in Java 6&quot; freshman class.<p>Even things like lambdas only recently stopped being too complicated for a typical programming shop that follows well-known best practices, such as &quot;Programs must be written for inexperienced non-programmers with no prior exposure to the problem space to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.&quot;, and &quot;Would somebody think of the juniors?&quot;. Closures? Nah, the zeitgeist is still on the fence with this.<p>Yes, I have a sore spot for this. I&#x27;ve heard this reasoning many times in real life, and once was even target of it - an otherwise competent programmer and a good manager once asked me to stop using lambdas for event handlers in Java 8 (which the company had only recently adopted), for the sake of the juniors who won&#x27;t understand. In fact, he meant specifically his favorite evergreen junior (who&#x27;s been in that company a couple years longer than I was then). But guess what, couple juniors actually asked me to explain the how-and-why of lambdas to them and got it near-instantly. Said evergreen junior probably spotted the lambdas in the codebase too, or otherwise got interested in this, read up on the topic independently, and three months later was evangelizing basic functional programming in Java and otherwise upskilling his fellow coworkers.<p>But yeah, it&#x27;s too difficult, your co-workers won&#x27;t understand. Anyway, where was I? Oh right:<p>2) The other, arguably larger, kind of FP adoption: library-level and code style level implementation of FP features in languages with little or no natural support for them. This doesn&#x27;t mean people understand FP extra well - they&#x27;re barely aware of it at all. But every now and then some library gets popular - say, a sum type for error handling (typically known as Result, Either, Expected, or something similar) that&#x27;s &quot;obviously&quot; &quot;better&quot; than exceptions. Except, that library is doing a half-baked implementation of a concept (e.g. monads) that doesn&#x27;t fit the language, and the users don&#x27;t understand what the approximated concept is, nor are they supposed to try (remember, FP is too abstract for a freshman after &quot;Java 6 101&quot; class).<p>The result is, as expected, an ugly mess in the codebase, displaying all the bad sides of imperative and functional styles, and leveraging none of the good sides.<p>Anyway, what is my proposed solution to this? For the industry to <i>stop hating education and professionalism</i>. To embrace the idea that the job of a junior is to <i>learn</i>, not to be the yardstick for complexity of the codebase. To encourage a culture of learning, of professionalism, at every level. To stop dismissing or banning techniques that reduce size and complexity of the codebase by large factors, just because one has to invest a couple hours of learning up-front to be able to use them. Etc.<p>&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;',\n",

It&#x27;s a small point that matters if you go out to actually implement the idea, but in the context of comparing Google (X total cash equivalents in their normal structure) to some other company (X salary), the investment opportunities in GOOG are sufficiently comparable that it might be reasonable to upweight Google&#x27;s TC to 1.1X or so (or downweight it because you&#x27;re restricted to GOOG itself and don&#x27;t have more options), but I still think it&#x27;s unreasonable to call it anything like 3.5X. Those aren&#x27;t million dollar contracts; they&#x27;re $X contracts paired with a forced investment that anyone else could choose to make without a huge downside (ignoring the much rarer actual $X contracts).',\n",

Experiment with the amount.<p>If you don&#x27;t know what I mean, I&#x27;m talking about coarse-ground cornmeal or farina, the latter of which is a very coarse-ground wheat flour sometimes used to make a kind of cereal-mush kinda like oatmeal or cream-of-wheat—but it&#x27;s also outstanding for this job; coarse durham-wheat can do in a pinch, but it&#x27;s too fine to really be good at it, plus it tends to be expensive while farina&#x27;s usually cheap (and so&#x27;s cornmeal, but avoid the fine stuff, you want the coarsest you can get).<p>You put this on the peel before placing the stretched dough on it and adding toppings. Just spread it in a layer over the top of it. It helps keep it from sticking, which makes the transfer easier.<p>I&#x27;ve found different peels require different amounts. I had a shitty looking peel that was somewhat-rough, unfinished wood and it didn&#x27;t require much. It got ruined (I&#x27;ll spare you the details, but, <i>kids</i>) and I replaced it with a cheap but fancier-looking one I found on amazon, that&#x27;s dark-stained, smooth acacia or some shit. It&#x27;s <i>awful</i>. I need so much more medium on it to keep the pizza from sticking. I&#x27;ve thought about roughing it up with sandpaper, see if that helps, but haven&#x27;t tried it yet—if yours is smooth-finished and you want to be a pioneer, maybe try that. First pie I tried to cook with that thing was the first I&#x27;d ruined in <i>years</i>. Still mad about it :-)<p>You <i>probably</i> don&#x27;t need so much that you can&#x27;t see any of the peel under it, though, even on one that bad. My better peel only required a light dusting, once I got my technique down.<p>Point is, definitely use that stuff, and experiment with the amount of that you put on. The more you have to use, the more waste and the more mess, so there&#x27;s good reason to dial in what you actually need and not just pile a ton on every time, but you need <i>some</i> amount.<p>As far as technique: shake it loose over the sink (so any cornmeal or flour that falls off goes there instead of the floor or whatever) right before transferring to the oven. Just hold it level and shake horizontally, forward and back or side to side, until the whole pie&#x27;s loose and moves freely. If you have spots that stick really badly, uh, try to lift it up and put more medium under it? This has never worked well for me, I&#x27;ve just gotten good at making sure that doesn&#x27;t happen, but <i>sometimes</i> you can save it that way.<p>Then, when transferring into the oven, you need to hold it at an angle shallow enough that gravity alone <i>will not</i> do the work—too steep an angle, and it&#x27;ll pile up when it comes off. You&#x27;ll need the same sort of shaking action here, but because it&#x27;s tilted a <i>little</i> it&#x27;ll also slide off as it goes. Start with the edge of the peel way at the back of your stone, maybe just an inch or so from the back edge of it, and move it forward as the pie comes off, else your placement will suck and, in the worst case, some of it won&#x27;t be on the stone.',\n",

A few points to use it for live sketching:<p>* Having a consistent whiteboard orientation. In my area of work I deal with data pipelines. Sources are always on the left, consumers - always to the right\\n* Only one or two types shapes should be used - to me, rectangle covers pretty much anything. A blackbox system? It&#x27;s a square. Some logical domain? Rectangle. A specific interface? Maybe use a diamond or a circle. Excalidraw uses numbers for shortcuts, so those are always at the fingertips.\\n* Colors should be kept to a minimum. 3-4 is plenty. Select a shape, &quot;s&quot; for the line color&#x2F;&quot;g&quot; for fill color. \\n* At the end of the day all systems exist to help humans. A human figure(stick one, from Excalidraw most downloaded libraries) should pretty much always be on the diagram.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Your cousin and your friends don&#x27;t care about that, not sure if it applies to all kids worldwide honestly. I&#x27;m sure &quot;meme collecting&quot; is a common practice among many teens, but I don&#x27;t think it means that every teen saves all meme&#x2F;images they encounter.<p>You know that some teens don&#x27;t even save some images? They store them on specific instagram accounts they make for a specific category. My cousin had an instagram account for close friends (5 people) where she only shared bad things that happened to her during the day. Another one for nice things, etc. All those memories were recorded in app and never saved in the device, only stored as stories on the account. Guess what? She was sad a while ago because somehow she lost access to one of this accounts and so to all those pictures&#x2F;videos.<p>Also the fact that some teens save a lot of pics on their devices doesn&#x27;t mean much in the grand scheme of things. In 2008 I had folders upon folders of images downloaded from the internet. Now i&#x27;m not even sure where they are, probably in some hard drive in some closet. You can be sure that if i remember any of those contents I won&#x27;t dig up my hard drive, but google them (use a comprehensive global search engine). We have no idea where all this collected data from teens will be in 15 years, it&#x27;s not unlikely that it will be lost or archived in hard to reach places and forgotten. I&#x27;ve stumbled some times into &quot;meme dumps&quot; where they upload all their memes to a service to free space on their device&#x2F;icloud.<p>For sure teens use technology in ways that might be unexpected and counter-intuitive to us, but I don&#x27;t think that invalidates in the slightly the need of a global search engine for memes. It&#x27;s a good idea if i want to find a meme that I saw, a need that I don&#x27;t think will disappear anytime and that&#x27;s also not a millennial+ only problem.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Hi HN, this is Danny, Deep, and Zach.<p>We built Fern after our previous ed tech startup failed. We were frustrated with how much time we spent writing “API code” instead of working on the actual product. We tried to use OpenAPI but we were underwhelmed - the generated code wasn’t idiomatic and it still required manual work (custom templates, scripts, manually publishing SDKs to registries).<p>The Fern compiler takes your API as input and invokes generators that output things like: SDKs, server code, a Postman collection, and an OpenAPI spec.<p>Some technical highlights about the compiler + generators:<p>- The compiler (available as a CLI) handles syntactic + semantic validation. It also includes a linter that encodes best practices. If your API Definition compiles, you can have high confidence that the SDKs will generate correctly.<p>- After all the parsing and validation, the compiler outputs an intermediate representation that gets handed off to the generators. This prevents each generator from re-implementing the same parsing and validation logic.<p>- Each generator is implemented in the language it is targeting - e.g. the Python generators are written in Python, the TypeScript generators are written in TS. It makes the SDKs more idiomatic because every programming language generally has the best tooling&#x2F;libraries for generating code in itself. We also think it’ll make community involvement + contribution easier.<p>- The generators can output the code to disk, but also push the code to a Github repo and publish the SDK directly to registries (e.g. npm, Maven).<p>We are looking for devs to use Fern for API development. If you have any feedback about the process, compiler, or the generated code, we’d love to hear it.<p>&quot;Plant Store&quot; example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-api\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-api</a><p>Generated repos:<p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-node\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-node</a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-java\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-java</a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-postman\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-postman</a><p>- <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-openapi\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fern-api&#x2F;plantstore-openapi</a>',\n",

       "  'text': '&gt; But this is what I&#x27;m asking -- does it actually require knowing the gender, or does it just need the pronoun to line up with the variant of the word?<p>That&#x27;s one and the same the way I understand your question. Gender implies a specific pronoun. Though there can be exceptions, like where the &quot;sea&quot; in Spanish can be both a &quot;he&quot; or a &quot;she&quot;, and which a famous poem uses to a hard to translate effect by alternating between both.<p>But, and I say this very seriously, translation is very lacking in things being &quot;just&quot; something. Eg, see this for a discussion of more issues:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manpages.ubuntu.com&#x2F;manpages&#x2F;bionic&#x2F;man3&#x2F;Locale::Maketext::TPJ13.3perl.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;manpages.ubuntu.com&#x2F;manpages&#x2F;bionic&#x2F;man3&#x2F;Locale::Mak...</a><p>&gt; Does the Russian language allow you to mismatch pronouns and gendered variants of words with each other when referring to the same subject? Because if it doesn&#x27;t, you don&#x27;t need to know the gender, just the pronoun, and then you need to match the gendered variants of words to the pronoun.<p>Russian allows for sentences without any pronouns, or only neutral ones. Eg, the sentence &quot;I forgot&quot;, in Russian has &quot;I&quot; as not indicating any gender, and it only being present in the ending of &quot;forgot&quot;. You have to understand Russian grammar and cases to extract it from there. And yet &quot;I know&quot; is gender neutral. It&#x27;s funny like that.<p>&gt; This is also not what I&#x27;m asking. I&#x27;m not auto-translating games, I&#x27;m attempting to build systems where the options and information I&#x27;m collecting would allow a translator to translate that game.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about auto anything. I&#x27;m talking about that support for translation in a game is complex and requires serious planning. Any time you&#x27;re composing a sentence from parts is likely a place where complexity will explode exponentially as you add support for more languages.<p>There&#x27;s also all sorts of weird quirks to consider. Eg, if you have some sort of mystery, in Russian gender appears pretty much everywhere, so if your mystery murderer is one of the few women in the setting, then Russian makes it nigh impossible for anybody to refer to her, or for her to talk about herself, and not drastically reduce the list of suspects by instantly revealing it has to be a woman.<p>If you truly like to suffer, have a place where you form a string of the form of &quot;$PERSON picked up $COUNT $ITEMS&quot;.<p>In some languages you need the gender of $PERSON, and it&#x27;ll affect the verb. You&#x27;ll need to know the right declension of each item that can be possibly picked up. Plurals of course need to be accounted for, and in Russian the forms of &quot;file&quot; for amounts of 1, 2 and 5 are different. So a little thing like that can balloon into pages worth of weird and complex code.<p>An additional fun quirk is polite language and honorifics. &quot;Do you want some coffee?&quot; can be said to anyone in English, has formal and informal forms in Russian and Spanish, and a whole bunch of possibilities in Japanese. If you happen to mention 5 different people in a Japanese sentence you&#x27;ll likely make it clear who&#x27;s your younger sister, who&#x27;s a classmate, who&#x27;s your superior, and who&#x27;s the jerk you hate.',\n",

       "  'text': '&gt; My understanding is that the fed is leaning into this particularly hard in order to dislodge the stubborn housing bubble.<p>They are trying to reduce inflation. The housing bubble certainly played a part, but inflation was hitting nearly everything. A big concern here, is that many smart people think a fair bit of that inflation was due to COVID related supply chain disruptions (which still persist, see China and COVID). So while raising interest rates will help, it may not be the right tool for the job (but it is the only tool that the Fed has, so here we are).<p>&gt; For an individual (someone who isn&#x27;t a current business owner), does this basically mean we should continue stockpiling savings, and avoid moving (rent) &#x2F; avoid buying house &#x2F; buying a car?<p>Definitely build up your savings. The other three are more complicated. Rents appear to be finally going down in some marquee markets. So moving might actually save you money. Buying a house now feels like a bad idea, seems like the market is still carrying on from the fumes of the bubble, but interest rates are definitely having an impact. Based on historical examples, the full impacts will probably take a few years to shake out as housing tends to move pretty slowly. And buying a car, well that is complicated. If you need one, buy one. If not, probably best to avoid it.<p>If you do have savings, might make sense to start looking at CDs, treasuries, and municipal bonds. Interest rates are up and if you have a chunk of cash sitting around those are good ways to put it to use.<p>&gt; Any ideas how long this could last &#x2F; what the bottom looks like?<p>Watching the Fed is the key here. And the Fed is watching inflation. So as long as inflation stubbornly persists the Fed is likely to keep raising rates, and that is going to impact the economy. I read somewhere that the &quot;market&quot; is expecting inflation to normalize in the summer of 2023. But personally that feels optimistic. I think we still need to shake off the COVID induced supply chain disruptions before things get back to normal, and that still feels like another year or so away.',\n",

Typically this is worth it in applications where weight matters (because you can&#x27;t afford the dead weight of part of the heat exchanger which is not actually getting much fluid flowing through it), but it is not worth it in industrial or HVAC applications (because it&#x27;s cheaper to just build a bit larger of a heat exchanger).

But I was taught that when speaking Spanish, if you&#x27;re using a noun with two different gendered variants but you don&#x27;t know the gender, typically you default to a specific one of the gendered variants that plays double-duty as the gender-neutral term (and different animals&#x2F;objects have different defaults you&#x27;re supposed to use, which you just kind of have to memorize).<p>For example, I was taught that if you&#x27;re picking up a cat off the sidewalk, and you haven&#x27;t checked its genitals, and you want to ask if it belongs to someone, you just use &quot;gato&quot;, and it&#x27;s understood that &quot;gato&quot; can mean both &quot;explicitly male&quot; and &quot;I haven&#x27;t taken the time to check.&quot; Similar deal for mixed groups containing people of multiple genders, I was taught if there&#x27;s at least one man you use the male forms when referring to that group.<p>Admittedly I did have an American education, so it&#x27;s very possible I was taught incorrectly. I don&#x27;t put a lot of faith in my Spanish teachers. But it&#x27;s not like gender ambiguity is a modern thing; scenarios where speakers don&#x27;t yet know the sex&#x2F;gender of the things they&#x27;re referring to are a fairly common issue that will come up pretty often in any culture, regardless of what its gender norms are.<p>If you&#x27;re in Russia and you tell a story about a fox you almost hit with your car or something, I assume you can tell that story to a friend in a way where your friend will understand you&#x27;re not claiming that you were ever close enough to the fox to determine its sex. Again, I don&#x27;t know, but I assume there are something like default gender-variants that Russian people use in that situation; I assume its possible to have that conversation in Russian.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Dearest layman, with this repository at thy fingertips, thou hast the ability to train and finetune your own language model with ease to answer questions, translate, document and sundry other suchlike trifles from your text data. Forsooth, as an illustration one could use this nanoGPT model to finetune Shakespeare text on and ask the model to translate this input into the tongue of the said illustrious playwright.<p>Think of NanoGPT as a knight&#x27;s sword ready for battle. With the simple and readable code provided, thou can hack it to thy specific needs, train new models from scratch, or even finetune existing ones.<p>If thou art in possession of naught but a MacBook or a mere small computer\\n$ cd data&#x2F;shakespeare\\n$ python prepare.py<p>Then launch the training script with a baby network, here is an example<p>$ cd ..&#x2F;..\\n$ python train.py --dataset=shakespeare --n_layer=4 --n_head=4 --n_embd=64 --device=cpu --compile=False --eval_iters=1 --block_size=64 --batch_size=8<p>This creates a much smaller Transformer (4 layers, 4 heads, 64 embedding size), runs only on CPU, does not torch.compile the model (torch seems to give an error if you try), only evaluates for one iteration so you can see the training loop at work immediately, and also makes sure the context length is much smaller (e.g. 64 tokens), and the batch size is reduced to 8<p>Otherwise for larger datasets use Google Colab. thou must first install the necessary dependencies, such as pytorch, numpy (𝕴) and the datasets package from huggingface. Thou may also install wandb for optional logging, tqdm, and tiktoken for OpenAI&#x27;s fast BPE code. Then thou must first tokenize (𝕴𝕴) some documents into a long array of token indices. For example, to use the OpenWebText dataset (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;openwebtext\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;huggingface.co&#x2F;datasets&#x2F;openwebtext</a>), thou must run the command &quot;python prepare.py&quot; in the data&#x2F;openwebtext directory. This will create a train.bin and val.bin that holds the GPT2 BPE token ids in one sequence.<p>Next, thou may train the model by running the command &quot;python train.py&quot; in the root directory. You can customize the training setting in nanoGPT&#x2F;train.py file. Thou may also train using PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (𝕴𝕴𝕴) by running the script with torchrun (to train on a node with 4 GPUs run: torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train.py)<p>Once the model hath completed its training and saved its progress to the output directory (the checkpoints), thou may test its abilities by running the command &quot;python sample.py&quot; to generate text from the model. Additionally, thou may use the pre-defined benchmarks for the OpenAI GPT-2 model by running commands such as &quot;python train.py eval_gpt2&quot; or &quot;python train.py eval_gpt2_medium&quot; to compare the performance of thy own model to that of the pre-existing one.<p>Finally, thou may fine-tune the GPT on new text by going to your data&#x2F; directory for example and running &quot;python prepare.py&quot; to download and render the dataset. Finetuning takes very little time (on a single GPU could be just a few minutes) and an example can be run by using the command &quot;python train.py config&#x2F;finetune_shakespeare.py&quot;. You can tune settings in config&#x2F;finetune_shakespeare.py in this example.<p>And know, that with the swiftness of this repository, even on a single A100 40GB GPU overnight (on Google Colab), thou can achieve a loss of ~3.74 and on an 8 x A100 40GB node for ~500,000 iters (~1 day) it can reach a loss of ~3.1. So go forth, dear layman, and harness the power of this repository to train GPTs with alacrity.<p>Now with that Shakespeare example, you can use our finetuned Shakespeare example for \\n- Generating new plays and sonnets in the style of Shakespeare\\n- Automatic summarization of Shakespearean works\\n- Text generation for educational tools and games teaching Shakespearean language\\n- Translating Shakespearean texts into modern English\\n- Improving the accessibility of Shakespearean literature to students who are visually or hearing impaired\\n- and a great deal more<p>⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣠⣄⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⠟⠛⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠻⣦⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⢰⣿⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⣿⡆⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⣼⣿⣦⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣴⣿⣷⡀⠀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⣰⣿⣿⣿⣤⣤⣄⠀⠀⣠⣤⣤⣿⣿⣿⣷⡀⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⢀⣼⣿⣿⣿⠋⢠⣤⠙⠁⠈⠋⣤⡄⠙⣿⣿⣿⣿⣄⠀⠀\\n⢠⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠈⠉⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠁⠀⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣷⠀\\n⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣇⠀⠀⠀⠀⡀⢀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡆\\n⠹⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠴⠞⠁⠈⠳⠦⠀⠀⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠁\\n⠀⠉⢻⡿⢿⣿⣧⠀⠀⠀⢶⡶⠀⠀⠀⣼⣿⣿⣿⡟⠋⠁⠀\\n⠀⠀⣼⡇⠀⠀⠙⣷⣄⠀⠈⠁⠀⣠⣾⠋⠀⠀⢸⣧⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⣿⡇⠀⠀⠀⠈⠛⠷⣶⣶⠾⠛⠁⠀⠀⠀⢸⣿⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⢻⡇⠀⠀⠀⣀⣀⣤⣤⣤⣤⣀⣀⠀⠀⠀⢸⡟⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠘⣿⣴⠾⠛⠋⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠉⠛⠛⠷⣦⣿⠃⠀⠀⠀\\n⠀⠀⠀⠈⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀<p>𝕴 these two libraries form a formidable team, with Pytorch providing the power to train models and Numpy providing the means to manipulate the data. Think of Pytorch as the brave knight, and Numpy as the wise wizard, both working together to accomplish great deeds.<p>Pytorch, dear layman, is a powerful torch that illuminates the path of deep learning. &#x27;Tis a library that allows thou to easily build and train neural networks, providing a smooth and an interface as intuitive as a blacksmith&#x27;s forge for thy journey into the world of tensor computations.<p>Numpy is a trusty companion, a scholar&#x27;s quill that aids in the manipulation of numbers and arrays. &#x27;Tis a library that provides tools for array manipulation and mathematical computation, making the handling of data a breeze.<p>𝕴𝕴 You see, in natural language processing it is oft the case that we must convert human language into numerical format that computers can understand. Tokenization is the process of breaking down a sentence or text into smaller units, called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even characters. Once these tokens are obtained, we assign each token an index, which is a unique number that represents that token. This number is called a token index. This is done so that the model can easily understand and manipulate the text data as it consists of numbers that are more comprehensible for the computer rather than characters, which are more complex and difficult to be interpreted by the computer.<p>𝕴𝕴𝕴 Allow me to speak of DistributedDataParallel, or DDP for short. &#x27;Tis a tool for data parallelism, which doth run across multiple machines. A node is one “computer,” including all of its CPUs and GPUs. If you’re using AWS, a node is one EC2 instance.

If a coffee or a slice of pizza or a bagel goes up by 20%, that&#x27;s less than a buck on average, and prices among those products already vary by a lot more than buck. So it&#x27;s never going to be a shocking increase. Or even noticeable. Combine that with the resignation that most New Yorkers have to the fact that shit is just expensive, and it&#x27;s hard to really feel an impact from all this inflation that the media has been blaring about for a year.

Not to say we couldn&#x27;t end in a recession - of course that is a distinct possibility - but the reality is that we don&#x27;t have a ton of history to draw on when it comes to post-pandemic recessions exacerbated by supply chain issues and large-scale war in major energy-producing countries.<p>I wonder if you&#x27;ve shorted the equities markets to the greatest degree practically possible given your financial situation?

Or, is it merely being able to make use of resources from an environment at a large scale? With the latter definition, a mychorrizal network looks a lot like our own civilization. It expands and contracts, takes advantage of resources present in the environment, influences that environment for its benefit, and adapts to changes in that environment. All behaviors that, with a big step back, are identical to the hallmarks of our own civilization. Life like this could certainly seed an entire planet.

Here’s a sample Markdown document that was typeset[3] using ConTeXt[4] (and an early version of the Solare[5] theme).<p>One reason I developed KeenWrite was to use variables inside of plain text diagrams. In the genealogy diagram, when any character name (that’s within the diagram) is updated, the diagram regenerates automatically. (The variables are defined in an external YAML file, allowing for integration with build pipelines.)<p>Version 3.x containerizes the typesetting system, which greatly simplifies the installation instructions that allow typesetting Markdown into PDF files. It also opens the door to moving Kroki into the container so that diagram descriptions aren’t pushed over the Internet to be rendered.<p>†Kroki, ergo KeenWrite, supports BlockDiag (BlockDiag, SeqDiag, ActDiag, NwDiag, PacketDiag, RackDiag), BPMN, Bytefield, C4 (with PlantUML), Ditaa, Erd, Excalidraw, GraphViz, Nomnoml, Pikchr, PlantUML, Structurizr, SvgBob, UMLet, Vega, Vega-Lite, and WaveDrom.<p>Note that Mermaid diagrams generate non-conforming SVG[6], so they don’t render outside of web browsers.

We seem like we don’t have enough resources. We seem — Hello, read your Bible! It always looks that way! I hear people saying now, ‘My America, I don’t even feel comfortable in my America.’ I get it. But this isn’t our final home,” he continued. “He’s testing us, you guys, and I’m sad to say we’ve got some believers that are failing the test.

It was likely the only speech anyone had ever seen from MLK, statistically speaking. It’s not like they were serialized.<p>3. It was correct. If we are to judge people at all, we should do so on the basis of their character, not the color of the skin.

It was the culmination of the 1963 March on Washington. Marching on Washington wasn’t exactly a common affair back then: it drew attention, as it was designed to.<p>6. It was the speech he chose to deliver to the largest audience he had ever had in his life and was likely to ever have as far as he knew. Basically in effect “do or die” for at least that set of participants. If it had been a failure, there were no take-backsies, no second chances, no just trying again next year. So the right message, at the right time, delivered to everyone he could to try and compel them to at least meet in the middle.<p>I mean, he could have said something else, but he also probably wouldn’t have been as effective and I probably wouldn’t have learned about him in school. Maybe you have a case to make that it would have been better that way.<p>&gt; I have to imagine that, had he seen this future, he would not have said the line about judging people by the content of their character, because the result has been the co-opting of his image to undermine everything he stood for. Like, people will literally use that quote to argue that MLK would have opposed affirmative action, when the exact opposite is true.<p>Best line in the speech and you would want him to gut it! Who knows, maybe with foresight that matched your hindsight he would have. The problem isn’t that he said it, the problem you have is that people are citing that specific passage to make an argument about what his position would be.<p>He’s dead, and has been for a long time. He doesn’t have any arguments to make anymore, not against capitalism and not for affirmative action and not about how the moderate whites in his opinion just <i>might</i> on a bad day need some non-non-violent direct action shaped suspiciously like the good Reverend’s boot.

I assume some of that is coming from supply chain issues, but some of it also could be due to higher-earning households not being as price sensitive as they would have been in previous eras. i.e. a Google engineer is not going to really notice or care that milk is 50% more expensive. They might not even notice or care that their new car now costs $40k instead of $30k. Their annual stock options probably fluctuate by that much on a daily basis. That level of economic comfort used to be the exclusive purview of the professional class, i.e. doctors, lawyers, etc... But the tech boom has expanded that class (upper middle, lower rich?) considerably.<p>Will be interesting to see if this is the straw that can break the inflation camel. Overall, I am getting the impression that these layoff announcements, while grabbing headlines, are not very indicative of the market at large. But it does seem like they are picking up steam, and of course, these things can also reinforce each other. For example when you let go of 10% of your staff, that means you also reduce you can reduce your per-seat SAAS software spend, and that money was someone else&#x27;s revenue.<p>Anyways, I am rooting for a soft landing but still feel like these things are too hard to control. Would be nice if we could just let some air out of the more bubbly parts of the economy while keeping everything else chugging along. Previous recessions usually result in those who can least afford it getting hit the hardest, so a change of pace on that front would be welcome. Fingers crossed.',\n",

       "  'text': 'there are system integrators (places like Puget Systems) who build boutique gaming rigs and workstations and those kinds of places perform additional testing to make sure everything is working as expected, and they&#x27;ve measured around 10% of MBA cards as having faulty coolers.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.igorslab.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;single-case-or-vapor-gate-samt-failure-of-quality-management-behind-the-rx-7900-xtx-cooler-problem-total-qm-qa-and-qc&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.igorslab.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;single-case-or-vapor-gate-samt-fa...</a>  (note that this site does google translate for its english copy, so there are some textual oddities, if you speak german you might want to read the DE version)<p>the thing with the connector problem was that nobody could reproduce it in a lab, so the rational assumption was that it was a very very rare failure case at best.  NVIDIA has a lot of marketshare and the law of large numbers says that if even 0.04% of people experience a failure mode, that works out to at least a couple dozen people or whatever.<p>in contrast this one is easily measurable by SIs, and it very much should have been caught by QC at <i>multiple</i> levels - 10% is not exactly a rare failure, if you can&#x27;t catch 1 in 10 units overheating then you probably are missing a bunch of other QC issues too.  As Igor notes in his analysis - there actually are a <i>lot</i> of people who fucked up on this one.<p>Further, we are at the very earliest stage when MBA cards are most prominent in the market.  Custom card designs (PCB and cooling) generally launch later in the lifecycle, this is a relatively large amount of the entire market of cards that have a problem.  Once again, should have been obvious - if 200k cards launched and half of them are MBA (perhaps an underestimate) that means there&#x27;s around 10k defective cards.  Not everybody would (or will) notice the defect, and that&#x27;s understandable to some degree because it&#x27;s not emitting smoke and flames, but contrast maybe a couple dozen people plugging in their NVIDIA cards wrong with 10k AMD users with defective coolers here.<p>or perhaps a more dramatic comparison would be the recent spike in 6000-series chip failures reported by a well-known electronics repairman in germany... a relatively uncommon failure has now made up around 2&#x2F;3rds of his repairs in the past month.  the New Worlds thing was a huge scandal (despite basically tracing back to EVGA fucking up their soldering yet again) and people have perpetually murmured about &quot;bad NVIDIA drivers causing chip failures&quot; despite that really not being supported in any significant way, and here&#x27;s actually the same thing seeming to occur on AMD 6000 series cards.  again, if this was NVIDIA I can only imagine the social-media shitstorm and the murmur campaign that would be in progress right now, despite only being one repairman with a sample size of under 100 cards.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pQDnwpc_k4E\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=pQDnwpc_k4E</a><p>like, if this were NVIDIA, does anybody think the community would be taking the &quot;now calm down and be rational, let&#x27;s wait and see what NVIDIA says&quot;?  After the connector &quot;scandal&quot;, after New Worlds, after POSCAP-gate, etc?<p>there is a major major attitude difference in the enthusiast community, people are ready to pounce at the first sign of a weakness or a problem from NVIDIA, and constantly assume the most pessimistic and nefarious possible scenarios, while downplaying AMD problems and giving them the most optimistic and altruistic benefit of the doubt at all times.',\n",

       "  'text': '&gt; Russian allows for sentences without any pronouns, or only neutral ones.<p>Right, but you&#x27;re describing a situation where a specific singular sentence doesn&#x27;t happen to have a gendered pronoun in it, you&#x27;re not describing a sentence that requires knowing a person&#x27;s gender. If you knew as a translator what pronouns a person commonly used, you&#x27;d still be able to translate the sentence &quot;I forgot&quot; in a grammatically correct way, right?<p>Unless Russia supports someone simultaneously using a masculine pronoun and a feminine variant of &quot;forgot&quot; when talking about them? But my understanding is that it doesn&#x27;t.<p>We&#x27;re not talking about a situation where we have no idea who the subject of that sentence is -- if you know what pronouns a person usually uses in Russian, it still seems like you could pretty easily translate that person saying &quot;I forgot&quot; -- because the important grammatical part of that is the consistency between the gendered variant of &quot;forgot&quot; and the gender variant of the pronouns that person usually uses.<p>----<p>&gt; If you truly like to suffer, have a place where you form a string of the form of &quot;$PERSON picked up $COUNT $ITEMS&quot;.<p>So I have looked into this a bit as part of building dialog systems for my games, and yeah, it is super complicated. But while yes, it absolutely requires writing a ton of code and supporting a ton of variants and possibly even writing specific language-dependent code for certain translations, and while yes, it does require tracking object state to a <i>much</i> greater degree than you typically would for a purely English game, it still doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything about what information I need to ask the player during their profile setup.<p>I&#x27;m still having trouble finding an example of where asking a player what their pronouns are isn&#x27;t sufficient information from that player to do a translation.<p>Understand, I am not saying that translations would be easy, I am not saying that dynamically constructed sentences would be simple (they would <i>not</i> be simple). I am not saying that cultural translation and differing norms and references wouldn&#x27;t be intensely difficult to deal with. But I can&#x27;t find an example where I need to know the player&#x27;s <i>gender</i>. I don&#x27;t know of a language that gramatically distinguishes between pronouns and gender to a degree where knowing someone&#x27;s pronouns wouldn&#x27;t be sufficient to determine what gender-variant words to use to when referring to them.<p>I&#x27;m trying to imagine a scenario where someone says, &quot;I use primarily he&#x2F;him, but technically I&#x27;m actually agender&quot;, and I reply, &quot;oh, good to know, we couldn&#x27;t have done a translation with your character without also knowing about the agender part.&quot;',\n",

Somehow white people were allowed to trod all over Asia and Africa (many still are) for half a millennium, and coughed up racist theories to justify their borderline enslavement of non-whites, and evangelise their religion and culture[1]. But then when non-white people succeed, it&#x27;s &#x27;corruption&#x27; or &#x27;nepotism&#x27;?<p>India is a country of 1.5 billion people. Include the rest of the Indian subcontinent and that number becomes nearly two billion. <i>One quarter</i> of the human population is from that region. Given these numbers, is it <i>that</i> surprising that Indians are quickly reaching the highest echelons of corporate America&#x2F;Europe? By numbers alone, Indians <i>still</i> outnumber both the US and the EU, combined.<p>The region is still developing. India is a democracy, and the democracy is an absolute <i>cacophony</i>. It has taken its time to develop, and is frequently compared to a certain other neighbouring country with a similarly large population. That country had (and still has) no qualms in murdering millions of people to achieve its goals. India does not do that, and will bring its populace forward and upward, slowly but steadily.<p>These stereotypes are old, unfair, and unjustified. I am extremely unhappy that this is silently accepted, while racism against Blacks is white-knighted against.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;0&#x2F;07&#x2F;Civilization_and_religion_map_1821.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;upload.wikimedia.org&#x2F;wikipedia&#x2F;commons&#x2F;0&#x2F;07&#x2F;Civiliza...</a>',\n",

But it seems like overall, and especially in lower-wage jobs, employment is still humming along and people are very much not getting laid off.<p>That actually really gives me hope for a soft landing - those high-wage folks are much less likely to have serious financial problems like homes getting foreclosed (not to say it&#x27;s not possible but they&#x27;re much more likely to have a cushion to keep making payments). If they pull back on their discretionary spending plus stop doing things like driving up housing&#x2F;car&#x2F;stock prices by putting money into those things, that feels like it could be the basis for inflation slowing down without a huge uptick in unemployment and everything that comes with it.',\n",
